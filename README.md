U-Net Segmentation:-
=============
 While converting an image into a vector, we already learned the feature mapping of the image so why not use the same mapping
 to convert it again to image. This is the recipe behind UNet.Use the same feature maps that are used for contraction to 
 expand a vector to a segmented image. This would preserve the structural integrity of the image which would reduce distortion
 enormously. and it is mainly uses in biomedical image segmentation.

wide-Net Segmentation:-
=============
wide unet also has same structure like unet. but it uses different filters than unet in every convolution or deconvolution.
thus it increases total params. and give a significantly change in accuracy.

total params = 9,282,876

 Nested_UNet or UNet++ Segmentation:-
=============
For the first time, a new architecture, called UNet++ (nested U-Net architecture), is proposed for a more precise
segmentation. We introduced the intermediate layers to U-Nets, which naturally form multiple new up-sampling expanding paths
of different depths, resulting in an ensemble of U-Nets with a partially shared contracting path.

total params = 2,261,889
